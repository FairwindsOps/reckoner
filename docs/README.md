# Reckoner Documentation

## Course YAML Definition
The "course" is the definition of charts you wish to install using Reckoner. It consists of settings that tell Reckoner how to use helm to install your charts, in which namespaces and with what values. The course also outlines what remote chart repositories you'd like to be able to pull charts from. We fully expect the course file to be checked into your code repositories and managed as you would manage any other infrastructure as code.

We'll be breaking this documentation down into sections to make reference easier. We'll be starting by looking at top level definitions in your course YAML and breaking down into the lower level objects that make up the course. Keys will be denoted as required, otherwise they are optional.

# Top Level Keys
- `namespace` _(string)_ _**(required)**_
    The default namespace for any chart definitions in your course
- `namespace_management` _(object)_ **(optional)** a structure the defines default annotations and labels to the namespaces that Reckoner will create
- `charts` _(object)_ _**(required)**_
    The charts and chart definitions to install with this course, must be alphanumeric between 1 and 63 characters (also allows underscore and dash)
- `hooks` _(object)_
    Allows `pre_install` and `post_install` which can be a string or a list of strings to execute in the shell around your chart installation (execution working directory is relative to your course file)
- `repositories` _(object)_
    The definition of remote chart repositories available to this course
- `minimum_versions` _(object)_
    The minimum helm and reckoner versions required to run this course
- `repository` _(string)_
    The default remote repository for charts in this course if one is not defined in the chart definition
- `context` _(string)_
    The `kubectl` context to use for this course (found with `kubectl config current-context`)
- `_references` _(object)_
    An area in which you can put repeat code to be used throughout your course YAML. (See [this article on anchors](https://medium.com/@kinghuang/docker-compose-anchors-aliases-extensions-a1e4105d70bd))
- `helm_args` _(string)_
    The default helm arguments to provide to any helm command run by Reckoner in this course

Example:
```yaml
namespace: kube-system
namespace_management:
  default:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        ManagedBy: com.fairwinds.reckoner
      labels:
        labelName: labelValue
    settings:
      overwrite: True
context: my-kube-cluster
repositories:
  stable:
    url: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
hooks:
  pre_install:
    - ls ./
  post_install:
    - kubectl get namespaces
charts:
  my-metrics-server: # See below for chart schema
    repository: stable
    chart: metrics-server
```

## Charts
The `charts` block in your course define all the charts you'd like to install and the values that the chart should be installed with. The `key` of your chart definition is the name (`release-name`) that Reckoner will ask helm to install under. Release names only allow alphanumerics, underscores and dashes and must be between 1 and 63 characters long.

- `namespace` _(string)_
    The namespace in which to install this chart (overrides root level `namespace` definition)
- `namespace_management` _(object)_ **(optional)** a structure the defines default annotations and labels to the namespace that Reckoner will create. Structure matches the `default` structure at the top level `namespace_management` block.
- `chart` _(string)_
    The name of the chart in the remote chart respository (example: `nginx-ingress`) and when using git repositories this is the folder in which the chart files exist
- `repository` _(string)_ or _(object)_
    The name of the remote chart repository defined in the root level of your course (example: `stable`) and also can be passed a repository definition (like in the root key `repositories`)
- `version` _(string)_
    The version of the chart in the remote chart repository (NOTE: When using a git repository, this is translated into the `ref` in the git repository, either commit SHA or tag name)
- `hooks` _(object)_
    Allows `pre_install` and `post_install` which can be a string or a list of strings to execute in the shell around your chart installation (execution working directory is relative to your course file)
- `files` _(list of strings)_
    Translates into `-f filename` for the helm install command line arguments (files are pathed relative to your course file)
- `values` _(object)_
    Translates into a direct YAML values file for use with `-f <tmpfile>` for the helm install command line arguments
- `set-values` _(object)_
    Translates all key-values into `--set` values for the helm install command line arguments
- `values-strings` _(object)_
    Translates all key-values into `--set-string` values for the helm install command line arguments
- `plugins` _(string)_
    Prepend your helm commands with this `plugins` string (see [PR 99](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/reckoner/pull/99))

```yaml
...
charts:
  my-release-name:
    chart: nginx-ingress
    version: "0.25.1"
    namespace: nginx-ingress
    namespace_management:
      metadata:
        annotations:
          foo: bar
        labels:
          boo: far
      settings:
        overwrite: false
    repository: stable
    hooks:
      pre_install: echo hi
      post_install:
        - echo finished
        - echo ":)"
    values:
      set: these
      values:
        - for
        - me
        - please
...
```

## Repositories
This block defines all the remote chart repositories available for use in this course file. This definition can be used in the root level `repositories` block, or in the chart level `repository` block definition. NOTE: It cannot be used in the root level `repository` definition.

Keys:
- `url` _(string)_
    The URL of the http chart repository
- `git` _(string)_
    The git endpoint from which to pull the chart, in SSH or HTTP form (i.e. `git@github.com:FairwindsOps/charts.git`)
- `path` _(string)_ _**git specific**_
    The path in the remote git chart repository in which to find the chart (i.e. `stable`)
- `name` _(string)_
    The name to use for this remote chart repository in `helm repo list`, if not defined then the key of the definition is used

Repositories definitions support both HTTP and GIT endpoints for pulling charts. Below are the two supported schemas for each implementation.

### URL Based Chart Repository
```yaml
...
repositories:
  stable:
    url: https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
...
```
### Git Based Chart Repository
When using git repositories, the behavior of the `chart` and `version` fields change in the charts block. The `chart` becomes the folder in which the chart lives and `version` becomes the git ref (commit sha or tag or branch name).
```yaml
...
repositories:
  fairwinds-stable:
    git: https://github.com/FairwindsOps/charts
    path: stable
...
charts:
  polaris-dashboard:
    namespace: polaris-dashboard
    repository: fairwinds-stable
    chart: polaris # git folder
    version: f0af192d4eaa57bd0a79602f90e448bf23d89581 # SHA, branch or tag name
...
```

## Minimum Versions
- `reckoner` _(string)_
    The minimum version of reckoner for this course to work properly (in semver notation).
- `helm` _(string)_
    The desired version of helm to run this course with (will fail if `helm` in your path is older than the version specified).

```yaml
...
minimum_versions:
  helm: 2.14.3
  reckoner: 2.1.0
```

## Namespace Management

When you wish to manage annotations or labels for the namespaces you are installing into with Reckoner, this `namespace_management` block to define default namespace metadata and the whether or not it should overwrite the values that exist.

`namespace_management` blocks can be defined at the top level or at the chart level. By default, the top level `default` metadata will be used for all namespaces and any `metadata.annotations` or `metadata.labels` set in the charts will be additive. However, if `settings.overwrite` is `True` then the `metadata` block from the chart will replace any matching labels or annotation values.

Keep in mind, chart level `metadata` properties _cannot_ remove or delete any course level properties, only overwrite the value. For this reason, it's best if you don't set course level namespace metadata unless you truly want it applied to _all_ namespaces defined in this course.yml.

Example:
```yaml
namespace_management:
  default:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        ManagedBy: com.fairwinds.reckoner
      labels:
        labelName: labelValue
    settings:
      overwrite: True
```
