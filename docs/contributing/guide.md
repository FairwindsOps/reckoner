## Installation for Local Development

Requirements
* Python 3
* pip

```shell
%> python -V                   # Check your version of python
%> python -m venv venv        # setup a virtual env in your cloned repo
%> source ./venv/bin/activate  # use the virtual env
(venv) %> pip install -e .     # Installs reckoner as locally linked folders
(venv) %> reckoner --version   # Check the version you're running in the virtualenv
```
Note that some of the above commands may need `python3` instead of just `python` to work depending on your environment.

*Note:* Python2 is no longer supported by this tool
