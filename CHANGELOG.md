# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.4]
- Added pipeline to distribute binaries (no code changes)

## [1.1.3]
- Added support for pyinstaller builds for Linux and Darwin (for later binary distribution)

## [1.1.2]

### Changes
- Added fix for interpolated variables in kube specs (see #82)
- Adjusted help for plot (--heading / --only also accepts -o now)
- Updated underlying dependencies (click, semver, GitPython)

## [1.1.1]

### Changes
- Adjusted versioning to be based on git tag
- Added support for python 3.6 & 3.7 with CI checks
- Added end-to-end basic tests for CI (invocation regression testing)

## [1.1.0]

### Changes
- Upgraded to oyaml 0.8+

## [1.0.2]

### Fixed
* Fixed hook runner behavior: Previous to v1.0.0, the hooks would stop running
  after the first non-zero exit code. This behavior broke with some refactoring
* Added tests to catch run-hook behavior

## [1.0.1]

### Fixed
* Reckoner would silently fail when a --only or --heading was defined for a
  chart that didn't exist in your course.  
  This behavior will still succeed if you provide at least one valid --heading
  value. If no values are in your course then this bubbles up an error
* Internal Fix: Reckoner Errors now are a single parent exception class
* Fixed hook output to user instead of hidden only in debug (#59)
* Fixed hooks to run from the same path as course.yml. This makes PWD relative
  to course.yml for easier groking of paths for hook pre/post install.

## [1.0.0]

### Fixed
- `version` command is fixed
- `generate` command is removed (was broken for several versions)

### Changes
- Adjusted schema to support `set` option for charts
  - This will translate all elements into `--set key=value` for the helm run
  - Current behavior actually does this for `values: {}`
  - All `values:` uses will warn that future versions will be type strong
- More testing for CLI contract options

### Deprecation Notice
In the future, the `values: {}` configuration of a chart will change it's
behavior (see Issue #7). The current behavior translates any `values:{}` into
`--set` for the command line helm. This makes certain object types lose their
type fidelity. This means `true` becomes `string("true")` when pushed through
`--set values=true`. To maintain the same behavior for your settings please
change `values:{}` to `set-values:{}`. This behavior deprecaton will start to
be enforces in later versions of Reckoner.
